# Monkey Island Image Converter
Version 1.2<br>By [Quick and Easy Software](http://quickandeasysoftware.net/)

A program that allows you to convert .DDS images back into the .DXT format used in Monkey Island 1 Special Edition and Monkey Island 2 Special Edition.

## New in this version (1.2):
- Added support for the Xbox 360 version of the games.
- Fixed the folder selection dialog not displaying correctly.

## How to use it:
Choose a folder to save the new files into.
Drag and drop .DDS files or a folder containing DDS files into the program window.
The files will then be converted.
If the DDS files are inside a subfolder then the new files will be placed into an equivalent subfolder when they are converted.

## Other handy information:
Both games will accept files that are not in the main .pak resource file.

Eg: If you wanted the game to accept a modified version of "ui/titlescreen/en-mi_startscreen_final_chunk_0_0.dxt"
You would first make an "ui" folder inside the game folder, then a "titlescreen" folder, then you'd put the "en-mi_startscreen_final_chunk_0_0.dxt" file inside it. The game would then use this file instead of the one thats inside the .pak resource file.
